# 🌸 Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies flowers using three different supervised learning algorithms:  
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Tree Classifier**.

## 📁 Files

- `flower_classification.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with all models and evaluation
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions

## 📌 Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
